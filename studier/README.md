# bible-jesus-research
A bible study app
This application is designed to have a possibility to read 
the bible in an interactive way with storing notes 
making highlights which are then displayed in all versions
The verses stored can be copied to the clipboard 
and there is a  way to use them in Mails
Another usage is to write something like 
devotionals with copying verses from the stored notes as 
well as from the highlights 
or directly from the bible you are reading
This way is may be faster than changing from 
an editor to a bible reader. This text can be exported as PDF.
And there is also a way to define plans.
What I have done on top is to have a way to hear the 
chapters even of NT while reading. For this you need downloads 
from https://diehoerbibel.com/downloads/
I will explain this when the version is more than DRAFT
I written this application to thank our Lord for his
word and to praise the Lord by delivering a possibility to read the bible 
in a electronic format which is especially developed for writing bible-software.
Praise our Lord Jesus
The bibles are interpreted with the zefanja.xsd.
The bibles cannot be delivered with the software so you have to download bibles 
in zefanja xml format and place them in a directory
On the page  I will give you as my preferred link 
there are also concordances (accordances) for a few
bible versions this files can be downloaded and put 
into ANOTHER directory (may be sub-directory) then the bibles
If you start first with a concordance the thing will be rendered to 
html this can take an hour for this files are very great. After that
the concordance can be used in the program. After the first startup you have to 
define the settings for the paths under study -> settings
Here is the preferred link I can not supply you with 
versions in cause of the copy right.

NEW: 

- Bible information is now displayed and the Information header for the dictionaries also.
- The generation of the dictionaries HTML is no more automatic
you have to click the study menu and there is a menu-item
  to generate the HTML files this is then done asynchronous
  with progress display in a separate window
- The configuration dialog is called automatic the first time you start the app
After saving configuration the program exits and after second restart the settings are active

THE PROJECT NEEDS A JAVA_HOME setting to a jre java 8
