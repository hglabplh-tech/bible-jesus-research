# bible-jesus-research
A bible study app
This application is designed to have a possibility to read 
the bible in an interactive way with storing notes 
making highlights which are then displayed in all versions
The verses stored can be copied to the clipboard 
and there is a  way to use them in Mails
Another usage is to write something like 
devotionals with copying verses from the stored notes as 
well as from the highlights 
or directly from the bible you are reading
This way is may be faster than changing from 
an editor to a bible reader. This text can be exported as PDF.
And there is also a way to define plans.
What I have done on top is to have a way to hear the 
chapters even of NT while reading. For this you need downloads 
from https://diehoerbibel.com/downloads/
I will explain this when the version is more than DRAFT
I written this application to thank our Lord for his
word and to praise the Lord by delivering his word in 
an electronic format to more people.
Praise our Lord Jesus
The bibles are interpreted with the zefanja.xsd.

Kind regards and be blessed and not at all stressed
